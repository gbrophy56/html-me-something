<p>Welcome to one of the many Tesla Fan Pages</p>
<p>This page will go on to talk about the history of Tesla followed by the many great 
    car models that they currently sell. I am personally a very big fan of Tesla

    expecting a Model 3 to be delivered to me this time next year. Because of this 
    I am going to go indepth about the model 3 and why it is going to be the 
    model that makes Tesla a house hold name.

            <h2>Tesla's History</h2>
            <p>Tesla the car of the future in stores now! Tesla was founded in
                 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley, these engineers 
                 found Tesla because they wanted to prove that electric cars 
                 could be better than gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s mission 
                 is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. 
                 Tesla’s engineers first designed a sports car with the
                  AC induction motor as it’s staple car, this motor was 
                  patented by Nikola Tesla (the company’s name sake) in 1888. 
                  The car was named the Roadster it launched in 2008 accelerating from 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds selling more than 2,400 giving Tesla’s birth in the car auto manufacturing industry. In 2012 Tesla Launched the Model S, this was the world’s first premium electric sedan and this Model made Tesla a big hitter in the automotive industry. In 2013 Motor Trend named it the car of the year with a 5-star rating from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2014 they adding the 85D features to the Model making it the world’s fastest four-door production car ever made. Tesla is currently expanding its manufacturing overseas in addition to it’s Lathrop, California Headquarters. In an effort to reduce the cost of their batteries Tesla has made a strategic partner with Panasonic to start construction of a gigafactory in Nevada. This Factory will facilitate the production of a mass-market affordable vehicles. The factory will also produce battery packs that will help them break into more fields of energy innovation.

                                                            <h2>Future of Tesla</h2>
                                                            <p>With all of those things said Tesla still has one thing that people love more than a healthy balance sheet and strong financials and that is the potential for dramatic growth in the near future. Some of the things that spark the potential for this anticipated growth include momentum, first mover’s advantage, and rapidly increasing demand for its vehicles. Over the last five years Tesla’s Revenue has increased by a compound average annualized growth rate of 103%. This revenue is mainly powered by the sales from the Model S sedan which just got rated by one rating agency as “the best car ever made”. Also with the delayed but now quickly climbing deliveries of the Model X targeting more to upscale families revenue is expected to increase dramstically seeing as only a couple of the last months of 2016 included the Model X’s sales. I believe that the high interest in the Model 3 is a big indicator of the market opportunity in the affordable long-range electric car market, and I think that Tesla stock holders will benefit from investing in this risky stock. In my opinion if Tesla can keep its growth going and keep up with increasing delivery demands Tesla will continue to be the stand alone long-range electric vehicle and will begin to take over some of Ford and GM’s Market share. This would further validate the fact that going after the “Next big thing” (Electric Cars) a worthwhile endeavour.
